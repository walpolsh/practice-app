# practice-app

This is an app to help my guitar students make the most of their practice sessions.

Each practice card features a timer, metronome, and a todo list to help them stay organized, and make progress faster.

Future iterations:
- Refine CSS/UI
- Save, edit, and delete muliple practice cards, each can be it's own topic.
- Add a recording interface
  - saved files will display as a waveform ala Soundcloud
